# malloc like allocator

Project realized during Operating Systems classes, it provides methods working similar to malloc from standard C liblary.
All `C` template files and grading scripts were provided by lecturers.
My task was to modify `mm.c` file to provide functionality to methods `malloc()`, `free()`, `realloc()` and `calloc()`.
